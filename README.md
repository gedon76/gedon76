# Gedon76

Hey, I'm a guy with a stupid nickname and suspended X page for whatever reason.

If you use GNU/Linux, check out [my dotfiles](https://github.com/gedon76/dotfiles/), maybe you'll like them

Also, I'm intermediate in English, so don't except me talking without mistakes.

<b>ALSO!</b> I was the lead programmer in [The Funkin' World of Gumball](https://gamebanana.com/mods/340874)... back in 2021, I don't even know what's happening with the mod now, I think it's cancelled
